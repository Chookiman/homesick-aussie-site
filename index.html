                <h3>What We're About</h3>
                <p>HomesickAussie isn't another travel blog. We're the platform where expat Aussies share the real stuff - the food disappointments, the cultural shock moments, and those rare discoveries that make living abroad a bit more bearable.</p>
                
                <p>Every story is written by someone who's been there. Someone who understands that you can love your new country and still miss the way things taste at home.</p>
                
                <p>We're not here to sell you anything. We're here to share what works, call out what doesn't, and help fellow Aussies navigate the weird world of international comfort food.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Because someone's gotta find the good stuff so you don't have to suffer.</strong></p>
