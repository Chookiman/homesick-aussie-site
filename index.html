                <h3>What We're About</h3>
                <p>HomesickAussie isn't another travel blog. We're the platform where expat Aussies share the real stuff - the food disappointments, the cultural shock moments, the expensive shipping decisions, and those rare discoveries that make living abroad a bit more bearable.</p>
                
                <p>Every story is written by someone who's been there. Someone who understands that you can love your new country and still desperately miss the way things taste, smell, sound, and feel at home.</p>
                
                <p>We cover everything from finding proper comfort food to navigating cultural misunderstandings, from expensive shipping mistakes to life-changing discoveries. Real stories from real expats who get it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Because someone's gotta find the good stuff so you don't have to suffer.</strong></p>
